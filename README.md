`dcorelib`, which depends only on standard scientific Python libraries such as numpy,
 is intended to provide a subset of the functionalities of these libraries.
When you publish a scientific paper on results obtained by using `dcorelib`,
we kindly ask you to cite software papers on these TRIQS libraries.
